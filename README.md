This project creates a simple web application that uses Django REST framework for the backend and ReactJS for the front end.  The web application is designed to build new facebook ad's that are typical of what you would see on the right hand side.  There is a text field for inputting the ad headline and a selector tool to choose the ad image.  When using these tools the preview updates live.  Underneath the preview add is a save button which allows you to save the ad for later usage.  To reload an ad there is another section with a selector tool that contains all the ads you have previously created.
